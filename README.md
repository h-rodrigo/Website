# Website
My website is comprised of 3 sections: research papers, courses, and apps and projects.  

Within the research section, you can access various my orginal working and published papers. My current interests lie in financial markets, asset pricing, systemic risk, and market design. 

Within the courses section, you can access various 101 documentation I have created for several software programming languages as well as topics on economics, finance, statistics, mathematics, and computer science. 

Within the project section, you can access my some ad-hoc apps I have built in my spare time as well as projects I have acted as an independent consultant on.
